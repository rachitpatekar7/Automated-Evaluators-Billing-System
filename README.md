## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT.
- **Exam Management**: Creation, viewing, and editing of exam records.
- **Automated Billing System**: Time tracking, invoicing, and PDF generation.
- **Email Integration**: Sends receipts via email using Nodemailer.
- **Responsive UI**: User-friendly interface built with React.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI.
- **Axios**: Handles HTTP requests between the frontend and backend.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.

### Backend
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Server environment and framework for REST API development.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud database for secure data storage and flexibility.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
- **Bcrypt.js**: Password hashing for security.
- **jsPDF**: Generates PDFs for billing receipts.

### Development Tools
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration.
- **Postman**: API testing.
- **VSCode**: Code editor.

## System Architecture
The application uses a client-server model:
1. **Frontend (React)**: Handles user interface, including login, exam management, and billing generation.
2. **Backend (Node.js/Express)**: Manages authentication, database operations, and billing logic.
3. **Database (MongoDB Atlas)**: Stores data related to users, exams, and billing.

The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful API calls, and the backend connects to MongoDB Atlas for data storage. User actions on the frontend trigger backend API routes, which perform database operations and return results to the frontend.

## Development Process
This project was developed using an Agile approach with iterative cycles of development, testing, and feedback. Key stages included:
1. **Planning and Requirements Gathering**
2. **Design**: Wireframes for UI and system architecture.
3. **Implementation**: Development of APIs and UI components.
4. **Testing**: Postman for API testing and browser testing for the frontend.
5. **Deployment**: Deployed locally for testing and feedback.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/automated-billing-system.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd automated-billing-system
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
4. **Start the frontend server**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
1. Register or log in as a user.
2. Create and manage exam entries.
3. Generate billing receipts and download them as PDFs.

## Results and Discussion
The system successfully meets its objectives by providing secure and efficient exam and billing management. Key accomplishments include:
- **Secure Billing**: Each transaction is verified, ensuring transparency.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Automatic PDF generation streamline the billing process.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The use of MongoDB Atlas allows for future data scaling needs.

However, challenges encountered included API response time, which was optimized by implementing caching strategies and reducing payload sizes in API responses.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates a secure and efficient billing system for evaluators, providing automated tracking, billing, and invoicing in a scalable web-based application. With its modular structure, the system can adapt to future needs in educational and professional billing settings.
